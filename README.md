# Introduction

The purpose of this device is to autonomously aim a nerf blaster at a target and fire it after the program is started. It is intended for use by children, with a similar use case as other foam-flinging toys, where the goal is to pelt friends and "foes" alike with harmless foam darts. However, the use of the design can reach far beyond foam darts. Given that the sensor detects heat signatures and operates based off of the greatest heat signature, the code can be used for other applications, such as autonomous fire control, where the device would aim water at a fire's greatest heat location (most often its base, which is where a fire should be targeted with water) to douse the fire.
